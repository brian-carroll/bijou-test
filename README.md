Installation
------------
Code is based on Scrapy, which has Python dependencies but also OS dependencies.
I've developed this on Ubuntu 14.04 and provided a shell script that works there.
If you have a different OS, your mileage may vary!
See [Scrapy installation instructions](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html)
```
./install.sh
```
